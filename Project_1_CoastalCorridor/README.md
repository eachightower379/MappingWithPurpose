# 🌊 Project 1 — Coastal Corridor Modeling

## 🧭 Purpose
This project models a **subsea cable corridor** between Bermuda and Nova Scotia to simulate real-world infrastructure planning. It focuses on route design, buffer development, and preparation for environmental and hazard assessment.

## 🧰 Methods
- Created BMH endpoints and KP points to structure the route
- Digitized the proposed route centerline in ArcGIS Pro
- Constructed a 20 km buffer around the route to define the study corridor
- Prepared shapefiles and map layouts to support subsequent analysis

## 🗺️ Outputs
- Route centerline polyline shapefile
- KP points shapefile
- BMH endpoint shapefile
- 20 km corridor buffer polygon
- Map layout PDF of the corridor
- Metadata and workflow notes

## 📝 Key Insight
Establishing a corridor framework provides a structured spatial foundation for environmental overlays and hazard risk assessments, mirroring standard marine cable planning workflows.
