# ⚓ Project 3 — Nautical Chart Digitization

## 🧭 Purpose
This project focuses on digitizing nearshore features from a nautical reference chart to simulate the early stages of subsea cable landing site assessment around St. George’s, Bermuda. It demonstrates how digitization provides base data for hazard visualization and planning.

## 🧰 Methods
- Imported raster screenshot of a nautical chart as a reference layer in ArcGIS Pro. Used shoreline boundary to georeference. 
- Digitized key features including:
  - Navigation markers and caution areas
  - Anchorage zones and depth contours (reference only)
- Created clean vector layers suitable for analysis and mapping

## 🗺️ Outputs
- Vector hazard shapefiles
- Digitized nautical elements
- Map layout of the BMH landing area
- Metadata documentation

## 📝 Key Insight
Digitizing chart features builds a foundation for more complex analyses, enabling planners to visualize nearshore hazards and design landing approaches with better situational awareness.
