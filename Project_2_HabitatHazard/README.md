# 🪸 Project 2 — Habitat & Hazard Assessment

## 🧭 Purpose
This project simulates a real-world environmental conflict analysis along a subsea cable corridor between Bermuda and Nova Scotia. The goal is to identify sensitive habitats and navigational hazards that intersect the study corridor to support responsible infrastructure planning.

## 🧰 Methods
- Overlaid the proposed route buffer with environmental and hazard datasets in ArcGIS Pro
- Analyzed spatial intersections with key features:
  - Coral reefs
  - Seagrasses, mangroves, salt marshes
  - Marine Protected Areas
  - Shipwrecks and obstructions
  - Major shipping lanes
- Classified risks and constraints along KP segments

## 🗺️ Outputs
- Environmental and hazard overlay shapefiles
- Map layouts showing conflict zones
- Attribute table summaries of impacted KP points
- Risk classification layers

## 📝 Key Insight
The analysis highlights sections of the corridor where critical habitats and shipping activities overlap, illustrating how environmental planning can guide route optimization and impact mitigation.
